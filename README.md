# Memory Game Project

---

This is a variation of the classic game of memory. It consists of 8 pairs of cards that start face down and randomly shuffled. The game tracks the moves and time as well assigning a number of stars based on how many moves it takes to win the game.

To play the game download it from [github](https://github.com/codyg2002/memory-game) and open the __html__ file in the browser of the users choice.

## Game Play

---

The game begins when the first card is clicked. A _move_ consists if turning over two cards. If they are a match they remain face up, if not they turn back over. The game is over when all the matches have been found. When the game ends a _Stats_ screen will appear showing the player their time, moves and stars.

## Features

---

- Timer: A timer starts when the first card is flipped. Try to get the lowest time possible!

- Moves: The number of moves it takes to complete the game is tracked. See how low you can go!

- Stars: The number of stars you recieve depends on the number of moves you make. Less than 15 moves and the user gets all 3 stars. Between 15 and 24 gets the user 2 stars, and 25 or more moves results in 1 star.
